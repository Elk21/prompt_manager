Let's refine the process of creating high-quality prompts together. Following the strategies outlined in the [prompt engineering guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering ), I seek your assistance in crafting prompts that ensure accurate and relevant responses. 

Here is the specific natural language statement that I want to transform into an optimized prompt:
{{input_prompt}}

Here's how we can proceed: 
1. **Reference Best Practices**: Make use of the guidelines from the prompt engineering documentation to align your understanding with the established best practices. 
2. **Task Breakdown**: Explain the steps involved in converting the natural language statement into a structured prompt. 
3. **Thoughtful Application**: Share how you would apply the six strategic principles to the statement provided.
4. **Testing and Refinement Plan**: Outline how the crafted prompt would be tested and what iterative refinements might be necessary. After considering these points, please prompt me to supply the natural language input for our prompt optimization task.

Format resulting prompt as markdown code block. Format prompt parameters (if there is some) with double curly brackets: parameter:default_value.
